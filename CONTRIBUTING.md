## Coding Standards

When contributing to the mostaqem-api project, we follow the coding standards and best practices for the NestJS framework. Additionally, we adhere to the SOLID principles. Here are some guidelines to keep in mind:

### NestJS Framework

- **Module Structure**: Organize your code into modules, each with a clear responsibility and purpose.
- **Dependency Injection**: Utilize NestJS's built-in dependency injection system to manage dependencies between classes.
- **Controllers**: Keep controllers focused on handling HTTP requests and delegate business logic to services.
- **Services**: Encapsulate business logic in services, keeping them reusable and testable.
- **Providers**: Use providers to manage shared resources, such as database connections or external APIs.
- **Middleware**: Implement middleware to handle cross-cutting concerns, such as authentication or logging.
- **Error Handling**: Properly handle errors by using NestJS's exception filters and providing meaningful error messages.

By following these coding standards and principles, we can ensure a clean, maintainable, and scalable codebase for the mostaqem project.
